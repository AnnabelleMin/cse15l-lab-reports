## Lab 1 Report
> Part 1: Install VSCode

Hello! This is the first lab report about getting the remote access. For starting that, you should download VScode on your desktop. [Click here for VScode download](https://www.youtube.com). You should see the webpage as the screenshot below. 

Then, select the system your laptop is (IOS/ Windows).

With all that installed, you should see the VScode page as below. The detailed installation part is skipped since I actually downloaded this few months ago and don't have to download the VScode again.

> Part 2: Remotely connecting

Open the VS code and the terminal, then type in % **ssh cs15lfa22dx@ieng6.ucsd.edu** (Don't include % in your input) And the "dx" part should be change into your own account number that is set for this course.

Then, you will be requested to enter your password to login. Type the password in the terminal. It is totally normal that the password does not show up in the screen. If you enter the password correctly, yayyy, you are in!

The successful remote control page should be very similar to the following screenshot.
